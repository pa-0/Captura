I also learned about the program **Captura** from chatting room. [Captura](https://github.com/MathewSachin/Captura) was first developed as an open source program first initiated by **Mathew Sachin**. But the author eventually abandoned the development and maintenance of this software due to some unpleasant experiences ([#406](https://github.com/MathewSachin/Captura/issues/405)) and a shift in interest ([#570](https://github.com/MathewSachin/Captura/issues/570)).

Looking at the Github code stats, the entire repository probably has less than **50k** lines of code. In the spirit of learning, I cloned this repository and found that it compiles directly on Visual Studio 2022, which is still very nice. During the period I also found some software bugs. this is a good software, it is a pity to be discontinued. So I want to have the opportunity to take over the maintenance of this software, so I made a fork [mrchipset/nCaptura](https://github.com/mrchipset/nCaptura) to start my modification.

I changed the repository name to **nCaptura**, which means `new-Captura`. Hopefully, it will lead to a new trip for this project.
